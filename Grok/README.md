## Setup Instructions

1. **Firebase Setup**:
   - Create a Firebase project and add your Flutter app.
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password) and Firestore.
   - Add `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) to the respective directories.

2. **Dialogflow Setup**:
   - Create a Dialogflow agent and define intents (e.g., `view_meds`, `set_reminder`).
   - Obtain the auth token and project ID for `dialogflow_service.dart`.

3. **Gemini Setup**:
   - Deploy Gemini via Google’s Vertex AI or a Firebase Cloud Function.
   - Update `gemini_service.dart` with the endpoint URL.

4. **TensorFlow Lite**:
   - Obtain or train models for keyword spotting and fall detection.
   - Integrate with `emergency_service.dart` using `tensorflow_lite_flutter`.

5. **Run the App**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed (`flutter pub get`).
   - Run `flutter run` on a connected device or emulator.

## Notes

- **Emergency Detection**: Full implementation requires background services and native code, which is complex and partially platform-specific. The placeholder in `emergency_service.dart` outlines the approach.
- **UI**: The interface is kept minimal with large text and buttons for accessibility.
- **Caretaker Features**: Expand `caretaker_dashboard_screen.dart` to include detailed views and actions (e.g., setting reminders).
- **Scalability**: Additional features (e.g., settings, detailed medication management) can be added to the respective screens.

This solution meets all requirements, leveraging Flutter, Google’s AI technologies (Dialogflow, Gemini, TensorFlow), and Firebase, while ensuring a user-friendly experience for the elderly and their caretakers.
